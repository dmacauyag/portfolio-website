            I am a Los Angeles based Full Stack Web Developer with a background in Civil Engineering. My time working as a design engineer for a civil engineering and consulting firm allowed me to exercise my strengths in both logic and problem-solving. I have had to exercise this skill from the stages of preliminary design all the way to the final design phases. My prior work experience has also taught me how to manage my time and work on multiple projects in high-pressure environments in order to meet strict deadlines.

            I have always been passionate about challenging myself to develop innovative and creative solutions to real-world problems. I am a highly motivated individual who is driven by developing quality products and ensuring that I provide the best services for my clients.
